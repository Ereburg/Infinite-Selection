  We know that verifying authenticity is a must for high-end footwear. When renting from Infinite
  Selection, you can feel 100% confident that the sneakers you receive are the real thing.
  Infinite Selection has developed a thorough authentication process to eliminate the possibility
  of you ever receiving fake sneakers from us.

<p class="authenticity-text">
  Here’s how we crack down on the fakes:
</p>
<p class="authenticity-text">
  <span class="text-dark-bold">Purchasing</span> – All of our sneakers are only initially
  purchased from legitimate retailers such as
  Footlocker, StockX, and Finish Line, who have their own verification processes and trusted
  distributors in place already.
</p>
<p class="authenticity-text">
  <span class="text-dark-bold">Authentication</span> – Even though we only buy from trusted
  retailers, we conduct our own in-depth
  review of every sneaker to confirm its authenticity before sending them to you. We are experts
  in identifying if sneakers are legit or not—down to the packaging it comes in. We check every
  sneaker’s construction detail, material, size, and colorway. Through this method, we ensure that
  every sneaker we send to you is authentic and you never have to worry about fake sneakers
  ruining your flex.
